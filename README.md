# FrankBot
This code represents a "For fun" Discord bot project carried out by me. The aim being to 
get a bot to respond to commands by sending the relevant images, gifs, and audio clips
if a user is connected to a channel. Also, being able to play videos from YouTube by 
searching or using a provided URL and control subsequent videos by pausing, resuming, 
skipping etc.  

edit: Due to discord api changes and the introduction of /commands, this bot no longer works
as of 23/10/22
